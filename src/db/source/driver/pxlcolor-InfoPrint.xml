      Under this entry Ricoh's PPD files for their InfoPrint-branded
      PCL XL color printers are hosted. PCL XL printers are supported
      by Ghostscript's built-in "pxlcolor" driver which is available
      in all Linux and Unix operating systems. So you only need the
      PPD file for your printer, no extra driver executables, to get
      access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains all
      information about properties and user-settable options which are
      specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show these
      options and allow the user to control all the printer's
      functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix
      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features
      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ... Note that
      although the printers are PostScript printers these PPD files
      need foomatic-rip. See the &lt;a
      href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ"&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PCL XL printers,
      with &lt;a href="show_driver.cgi?driver=pxlcolor"&gt;generic PCL
      XL PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all
      the printer-specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
