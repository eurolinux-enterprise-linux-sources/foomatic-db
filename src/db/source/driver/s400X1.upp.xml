      The S400 and the BJC-3000 (nearly identical printers) are also
      supported by Gimp-Print, but with this driver the author did
      more fine-tuning on the colour curves. He has even written some
      small program for that (downloadable from the driver's web
      page). He claims that the quality is much better than the
      quality of Gimp-Print or even Windows. The driver is only tested
      on plain paper, reports about its quality on other papers and
      additional optimizations for other papers are welcome.&lt;p&gt;
