      Under this entry Ricoh's PPD files for their Infotec-branded
      PCL XL monochrome printers are hosted. PCL XL printers are
      supported by Ghostscript's built-in &quot;pxlmono&quot; driver which is
      available in all Linux and Unix operating systems. So you only
      need the PPD file for your printer, no extra driver executables,
      to get access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains
      all information about properties and user-settable options which
      are specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show
      these options and allow the user to control all the printer's
      functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix
      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features
      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ... Note that
      although the printers are PostScript printers these PPD files
      need foomatic-rip. See the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PCL XL printers,
      with &lt;a href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=pxlmono&quot;&gt;generic PCL
      XL PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all
      the printer-specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
