      Under this entry Toshiba's PPD files for their PostScript
      printers are hosted. PostScript printers are supported natively
      in Linux and Unix environments, so you only need the PPD file
      for your printer, no driver executables, to get access to all
      printing functionality. The PPD contains all information about
      properties and user-settable options which are specific to the
      printer and makes printing dialogs show these options and allow
      the user to control all the printer's functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that PPDs only support the printing functionality of the
      printers, not things like scanning or faxing.&lt;p&gt;

      These printers also work, like all other PostScript printers,
      with &lt;a href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript&quot;&gt;generic
      PostScript PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access
      to all the printer specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
