    Driver for the Canon LBP-800 laser winprinter.&lt;p&gt;

    In contrary to the &quot;lbp660&quot; driver parallel port access goes
    through the kernel. So the driver does not need to run SUID
    root. The access is done via the &quot;parport_pc&quot; kernel module and a
    CUPS backend which comes with the driver. The driver does not work
    with USB- or network-connected printers.&lt;p&gt;

    The Foomatic PPD file for this driver is not available on
    OpenPrinting because it is already contained in the driver
    package.&lt;p&gt;
