      Under this entry HP's PPD files for those PostScript printers
      are hosted which are not supported by HPLIP. These are most
      DesignJets (large format printers) and one PostScript standard
      format inkjet (OfficeJet 9100, HPLIP supports it only in PCL
      mode).&lt;p&gt;

      See the &quot;&lt;a
      href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip&quot;&gt;hplip&lt;/a&gt;&quot; driver
      entry for all HP PostScript printers not mentioned
      here.&lt;p&gt;

      PostScript printers are supported natively in Linux and Unix
      environments, so you only need the PPD file for your printer, no
      driver executables, to get access to all printing
      functionality. The PPD contains all information about properties
      and user-settable options which are specific to the printer and
      makes printing dialogs show these options and allow the user to
      control all the printer's functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that the PPDs are originally developed for the Mac OS X
      operating system. So they contain entries which are not made use
      of under Linux.&lt;p&gt;

      The PPDs only support the printing functionality of the
      printers. To use additional functionality, like ink/toner level
      check, inkjet head cleaning, scanning, faxing, ... you need
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://hplipopensource.com/&quot;&gt;HPLIP&lt;/a&gt; in
      addition to the PPD files.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript
      printers, with &lt;a
      href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript&quot;&gt;generic PostScript
      PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all the
      printer specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
