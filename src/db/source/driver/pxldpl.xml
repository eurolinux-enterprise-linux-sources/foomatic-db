    "pxldpl" is not a new driver, but a special way of using the
    "pxlcolor" Ghostscript driver to make the Dell 3010cn (and
    probably other color laser printers from Dell) working. The trick
    is to replace the "PCLXL" by "DPL" (probably "Dell Printer
    Language") in the "ENTER LANGUAGE" PJL command. DPL is nothing
    else then PCL XL.&lt;p&gt;

    Thanks to Samuel Degrande for finding out that DPL is PCL-XL in
    reality and a special driver, as James "Shamus" Hammons' (jlhamm
    at acm dot org) "dplix" driver is not needed. Thanks to James
    Hammons for testing this method of using Ghostscript's
    PCL-XL driver.&lt;p&gt;

    The PPDs from this site use an ugly Perl workaround to patch
    Ghostscript's output data stream in order to make paper tray
    selection work as Ghostscript's built-in driver has a bug which
    breaks this functionality. This &lt;a
    href="http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;
    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the
    input tray with the "-dMediaPosition=X" commmand line option for
    Ghostscript. "X" is an integer number which depends on the printer
    model and tray. For HP "0" is usually the printer default, "1"
    automatic selection, "2" manual feed, "4" the upper, and "5" the
    lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers are
    different. The bug is also fixed in Ghostscript 8.64 or
    newer.&lt;p&gt;
